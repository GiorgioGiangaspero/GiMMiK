    """Generate source code for a matrix multiplication kernel.

    Generated kernels are capable of computing a matrix product of the form
        C = alpha * A x B + beta * C.
    The source code for the generated kernel is specialised according to the
    arguments given to this functions. The code can be then compiled and
    executed on the platform of choice.

    Args:
        data (:class:`numpy.ndarray`): The operator matrix *A*.

        platform (:class:`~gimmik.platform.Platform`): The platform to generate code for.
        Currently one of *Platform.CUDA* or *Platform.OPENCL*.

    Kwargs:
        alpha (float): Operator matrix multiplier. See description.

        beta (float): Output matrix multiplier. See description.

        double (bool): If True double-precision mode is used.
        Single-precision otherwise.

        reduced (bool): If True common sub-expressions will be eliminated.

        embedded (bool): Currently unused.

    Returns:
        string. The source code of the kernel.
